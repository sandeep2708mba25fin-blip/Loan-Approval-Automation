# 📌 Project Overview

This project automates the loan approval process using *n8n, **Google Sheets, **Gmail*, and rule-based decision logic.

The workflow evaluates loan applications based on applicant financial data, credit score, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and AML/PEP watchlist screening. Based on predefined business rules, applications are automatically approved, rejected, or routed for manual compliance review.

This project demonstrates how financial institutions can leverage workflow automation to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and strengthen compliance monitoring.
